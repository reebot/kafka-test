How to Access the ActiveMQ Administration Console:
Open a Web Browser: Navigate to http://localhost:8161.

Use the Management Console:

The default URL for the ActiveMQ web console is http://localhost:8161/admin.
If it's your first time accessing it, you might be prompted to log in.
Default Credentials:

Username: admin
Password: admin
These are the default credentials for the rmohr/activemq Docker image unless you've configured them otherwise.
Inside the Administration Console:
Queues and Topics: You can view and manage queues and topics from the console. This includes creating new queues or topics, viewing the number of messages enqueued, and browsing messages.

Send & Browse Messages: The console allows you to send messages to a queue or topic directly from the UI and to browse messages stored in queues.

Monitoring: View broker-wide statistics such as memory usage, store usage, and more. This is useful for keeping an eye on the health and performance of your ActiveMQ instance.
