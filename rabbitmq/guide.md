To access the RabbitMQ Management UI, you can navigate to http://localhost:15672/ in your web browser after starting the services with Docker Compose. You will be prompted for a username and password, which are set as environment variables in your docker-compose.yml file. Based on the previous example, the credentials would be:

Username: user
Password: password
Once logged in, you can use the Management UI to:

Monitor the RabbitMQ server's health and performance.
View and manage exchanges, queues, bindings, and users.
See message rates and data rates for publishing and delivery.
Publish and get messages from queues for testing purposes.
And more.
Remember that this UI is meant for management and monitoring and not as a primary interface to interact with your messages programmatically. For regular operations, you should interact with RabbitMQ through your applications using the appropriate client libraries.
